        <h3> A breaf resume</h3>
        <article>  Stephen William Hawking,  born 8 January 1942 is an English theoretical physicist, cosmologist, author and Director of Research at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology within the University of Cambridge. His scientific works include a collaboration with Roger Penrose on gravitational singularity theorems in the framework of general relativity and the theoretical prediction that black holes emit radiation, often called Hawking radiation. Hawking was the first to set forth a theory of cosmology explained by a union of the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. He is a vigorous supporter of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.  </article>

          <h3> A little list of what he did </h3>
          <li>  <p><b>1966</b>- Completes doctorate and is awarded fellowship at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. He works on singularities in the theory of general relativity and applies ideas to the study of black holes.</li>  </p>    
         <li><p><b>1968</b> - Publishes Large Scale Structure of Space-Time</li></p>
        <li><p><b>1970</b> - Discovers that by using quantum theory and general relativity he is able to show that black holes can emit radiation.</li></p>
      <li><p><b>1971-72</b>- Black hole mechanics
Black holes have their own set of laws that mirror the more familiar laws of thermodynamics. Hawking came up with the second law, which states that the total surface area of a black hole will never get smaller, at least so far as classical (as opposed to quantum) physics is concerned. Also known as the Hawking area theorem, it created a puzzle for physicists. The law implied that black holes were hot, a contradiction of classical physics that said black holes could not radiate heat. In separate work, Hawking worked on the "no hair" theorem of black holes, which states that black holes can be characterised by three numbers – their mass, angular momentum and charge. The hair in question is other information that vanishes when it falls into the black hole.</li></p>
      <li><p><b>1974-75</b>- How black holes can vanish
Nothing can escape a black hole, or so physicists once thought. Hawking drew on quantum theory to show that black holes should emit heat and eventually vanish. The process is slow for normal black holes. It would take longer than the age of the universe for a black hole with the same mass as our sun to evaporate. But smaller black holes evaporate faster, and near the end of their lives release heat at a spectacular rate. In the last tenth of a second, a black hole could explode with the energy of a million one megaton hydrogen bombs.</li></p>
    <li><p><b>1982</b>- How galaxies might arise
A popular theory in cosmology holds that the fledgling universe went through a period of rapid inflation soon after the big bang. Hawking was one of the first to show how quantum fluctuations – minuscule variations in the distribution of matter – during inflation might give rise to the spread of galaxies in the universe. What started as a tiny difference grew into the cosmic structure we see, as gravity made matter clump together. Recent maps of the heavens that pick up the faint afterglow of the big bang reveal the kinds of variations Hawking worked with.</li></p>
  <li><p><b>1983</b>- Wave function of the universe
Hawking has spent much of his time trying to develop a quantum theory of gravity. He started out applying his idea of Euclidean quantum gravity to black holes, but in 1983 teamed up with Jim Hartle at Chicago University. Together they proposed a "wave function of the universe" that, in theory, could be used to calculate the properties of the universe we see around us.</li></p>
          
<li><p><b>1988</b> - Publishes A Brief History of Time: From the Big Bang to Black Holes. The book is a worldwide best seller</li></p>
<li><p><b>1993</b> - Publishes Black Holes and Baby Universes, and other Essays, a collection of scientific articles exploring ways in which the universe may be governed. </li></p>
          
<li><p><b>1998</b> - Publishes Stephen Hawking's Universe: The Cosmos Explained, a book about the basis of existence. </li></p>
<li><p><b> 2001</b> - Publishes Universe in a Nutshell in the UK, a book explaining to a general audience recent breakthroughs in physics.</li></p>
<li><p><b>2002</b> - Publishes The Theory of Everything: The Origin and Fate of the Universe, a book presenting the most complex theories of physics past and present</li></p>
<li><p><b>2004</b>- Announces he has solved the Black Hole paradox. In doing so, he concedes that he lost a bet that he an Caltech theorist Kip Thorne had made with John Preskill, also of Caltech, about black holes. After nearly 30 years of arguing black holes destroy everything that falls into it, he admits that they may allow information within them to escape.</li></p>
<li><p><b>2007</b> - Hawking and his daughter Lucy published George's Secret Key to the Universe, a children's book designed to explain theoretical physics in an accessible fashion and featuring characters similar to those in the Hawking family. The book was followed by sequels in 2009 and 2011</li></p>
<li><p><b>2015</b>- Hawking helped launch Breakthrough Initiatives, an effort to search for extraterrestrial life.</li></p>
